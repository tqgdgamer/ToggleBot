## ToggleBot
A quality discord bot made with [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)

## How Did It Begin?
Originally, ToggleBot was started on December 1st, 2021. Without much experience at the time, it was sort of messy and very few commands were active and working. At the time, it was sort of a fun project out of spare time but slowly as new features began rolling out, a lot more has changed than it has a couple years ago.
